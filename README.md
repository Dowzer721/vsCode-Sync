# vsCode-Sync
All of my projects. Excuse the dodgy commits; I often work on numerous projects at the same time, meaning when I commit changes, they all get bundled together. 

I have set up Visual Studio Code to sync any changes I make to my local files with these files in this repository. This means that sometimes I will forget to commit my changes, until a few sessions later, which leads to me losing track of all the changes which I previously made. When I then remember to commit my changes, it asks me for a message for the commit, and I just clarify with "Multiple changes across N files". I know this is lazy, and I want to change my habit, which I am working on. But I usually forget at the end of sessions, which means my un-learning of this bad habit is slow. I wish there was a way for VSCode to remind me to sync my changes upon exiting VSCode, so that I would have to make a concious decision not to commit my changes. Maybe there is a way... I have asked on Reddit, so hopefully someone will come back to me soon.
