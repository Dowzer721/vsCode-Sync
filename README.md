# vsCode-Sync
All of my projects. Excuse the dodgy commits; I often work on numerous projects at the same time, meaning when I commit changes, they all get bundled together. This is a bad habit and I am working on breaking from it. 

Part of this process is adding a new README to each and every folder to explain what each project is and the progress I have made. This file will be the best way to see my thoughts on the project.
