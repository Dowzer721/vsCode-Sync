# This is not a money-grab, but a learning exercise. 
## I do not intend to make any monetary gains from these projects, but instead as a means of learning about the behind-the-scenes of games I love. 

#### It may also serve, in the future, as a way for me to demonstrate my own ability with programming and game creation, should I ever need to. 

###### If anyone has a problem with this, or wishes that I take down any of my source code, due to legal issues or risk-of-loss, please don't hesitate to contact me, and I will be more than happy to discuss this with you.
