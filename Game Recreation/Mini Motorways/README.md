## About (from Link):
> Mini Motorways is a game about drawing the roads that drive a growing city. Build a road network, one road at a time, to create a bustling metropolis. Redesign your city to keep the traffic flowing, and carefully manage upgrades to meet the changing demands. How long can you keep the cities of the world moving?

## What I like:
I really like the aesthetic of this game. The colours and maps are all really pretty, and well designed. But of course, I also really like the mechanics and the way the game actually plays. I really like how the cars follow the roads, and how they stick to their side of the road, instead of just going down the middle. I also like the grid layout of the game, because it means that the player is limited with where they can place roads and junctions etc, which makes for an interesting gameplay-loop.
